CCHS-AC - Access Control for CCHS Tools
=============

This Repo tries to solve the problem of limiting access to tools so that only trained users can get to them.

The eventual goal here is to have a dedicated controller board, plus an arduino sketch that can communicate with an upstream server.

The current server is built in django, but it's stored separately.  I guess I better include that as a submodule.
